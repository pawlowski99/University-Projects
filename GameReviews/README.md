# Web App for reviewing games
A copy of a [Spring Boot Team Project](https://github.com/slichota221/ProjektZespolowy/tree/main) I was working on with [s-porebski](https://github.com/s-porebski) and [slichota221](https://github.com/slichota221).

App allows us to create account, browse games and leave reviews.

### **My role** was to take care of the **front-end**.
